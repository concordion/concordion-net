        <p> Concordion.NET supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) similar to
          great frameworks such as Cucumber, SpecFlow,
          FitNesse, and NBehave. According to the
          excellent <a class="externalLink" href="http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2010/03/classifying-bdd-tools-unit-test-driven.html">classification
            of BDD tools</a>, this <em>BDD framwork</em> focuses on business readable input (and reaches business readable output as well).</p>
		  <p> Concordion <em>acceptance tests</em> are so readable, they can double up as system documentation. They are written in
          HTML, so can be easily hyperlinked into a navigable structure. With 
		  these automated acceptance testing,
          you can be confident the documentation is always up-to-date.</p>

		Documentation as Specification</h2>
		  <p>Agile methods help to get the highest possible value from the time 
		  invested. When investing a lot of effort into 
		  <a href="RunningTests.html">automated acceptance testing</a> with 
		  techniques such as Test Driven Development (TDD) the idea arises to 
		  use tests as documentation. But automated testing frameworks often prevent 
		  non-developers from participation. Additionally, tests are often 
		  strongly related to the technical aspects of the system and are 
		  difficult to understand by other stakeholders.</p>
		  <p>With the emergence of <em>Behavior Driven Development</em> (BDD) and
		  <em>Specification by Example</em> (SBE) we could use acceptance testing specifications as 
		  documentation. But specifications are still describing what the system 
		  should do from a perspective of construction. Additionally, 
		  specifications often use a structured language as scenarios in the 
		  form of given-when-then.</p>
		  <p>What about using documentation as specification? The main goal of 
		  software projects is to address customer needs and to deliver benefits 
		  to the project stakeholders. User stories of the form &quot;As&lt;role&gt; I want 
		  &lt;feature&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;&quot; remind us to focus on the benefit. The 
		  concept of Minimal Marketable Feature (MMF) and Minimum Viable Product 
		  (MVP) recognize that a single story may not have enough customer value. Thus, 
		  we have to change our viewpoint and look at the problem from the 
		  customer perspective. Documentation such as marketing papers or user 
		  manuals describe which benefits the software system can bring for the 
		  customer as well as how the desired benefit can be achieved.</p>
		  <p>Concordion.NET is a BDD framework based on HTML and can use the expressiveness of 
		  the web to describe the software product from the customer 
		  perspective. We can use documentation that shows how to use the 
		  product as inputs into our development process. BDD in plain English 
		  with the help of Concordion.NET enables to work outside in: first 
		  describe the customer benefits, drive your tests with this 
		  description, use the tests as basis for your implementation.</p>
		  <h3>From Specification to Living Documentation</h3>
		  <p>Traditionally specifications often focus on the product and the 
		  capabilities it should deliver. Thus, this type of documentation 
		  describes what the system does instead of what the user gains. It 
		  mainly lists the outputs the system produces based on the inputs. This is mainly targeted on the development team and 
		  not so much on the customer. An example of such a classical 
		  specification could look like the following example:</p>
		  <p><img alt="specification with examples" src="image/ClassicalSpecification.jpg" /></p>
		  <p>In contrast 
		  user related documentation describes system behavior from the customer 
		  perspective. For example a product box summarizes the greatest 
		  benefits the software product provides for its users. Moreover, a user 
		  manual explains how to interact with the system to obtain the desired 
		  benefits.</p>
		  <p>Such a type of documentation can also be utilized by the 
		  development team as well, to get a shared understanding on what to focus during 
		  the development work. As a result we get a new style to write 
		  specifications that changes the viewpoint from describing how the 
		  system should behave to how the user can get the benefit. An example 
		  of such a specification by documentation could look like the following 
		  example:</p>
		  <p><img alt="Specification by Documentation" height="853" src="image/DocumentationSpecification.jpg" /></p>
		  <p>Such specifications aren't only able to double as system 
		  documentation. They are in fact user documentation that double as 
		  specification.</p>
		  <p>For an example of such an documentation that is a specification as 
		  well, please have a look at the <a href="GettingStarted.html">tutorial</a>. It is composed of such active specifications.</p>

        <div class="memo">
          <p>As Concordion specifications are written in simple HTML, it provides a good basis for a <a class="externalLink" href="http://specificationbyexample.com/key_ideas.html">living
              documentation system</a>. You can use a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor like BlueGriffon 
		  or Microsoft Web Expression
              to describe your intended behavior of your software in simple HTML documents and instrument them to
            verify your system under test.</p>

            are readable to business people, it can help to achieve the goal of <a class="externalLink" href="http://jacekratzinger.blogspot.co.at/2012/01/purpose-driven-development-pdd.html">purpose

            specifications with a <a href="http://concordion.org/dist/1.4.4/spec/concordion/Concordion.html">small set
              of commands</a> (e.g. "set", "execute", "assertEquals"). These allow checking the examples against the
            real-life system.</p>
