# [Concordion.NET](http://www.concordion.org/dotnet/)

Concordion.NET is a small, handy Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework for C# / .NET that lets you turn plain English descriptions of requirements into automated tests.

A Concordion.NET executable specification consists of two parts: a well-formed XHTML document describing the expected behavior, and fixture code written in C# (a special Concordion.NET extension of a NUnit tests) that finds concrete examples in the document and uses them to verify the system under test. In order for the magic to happen, the document must first be instrumented with commands.

As the Concordion.NET framework focuses on business readable inputs, the specifications are are so readable, they can double up as system documentation. They are written in HTML, so can be easily hyperlinked into a navigable structure. With these automated acceptance testing, you can be confident the documentation is always up-to-date.
